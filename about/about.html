    <p>Hi, I'm Jeremiah. Welcome to Badger Studios. I am currently an undergraduate student athlete trying to obtain my degree in Studio Art at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 2018, I graduated from First Flight High School as a 2x State Champion in North Carolina for wrestling and was recruited by UNC to wrestle Division 1. I am also a self publishing comic book artist unde my label <strong>Badger Studios</strong> and as of now have only publish on comic book titled, "Rue." I am currently creating my very first graphic novel called "Tzaria" and have created this website to give you behind the scenes looks at the project as well as share my process.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My mission for Badger Studios is to teach you how to create and self publish your own comic books as well as share my own work. I hope you enjoy what I am doing and learn something along the way.</p>
